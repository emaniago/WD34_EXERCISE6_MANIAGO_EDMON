            <div class="overflowSample">
            <p>Millions of people participated in Cebu City last Sunday to celebrate the Sinulog Festival, one of the most famous festivals in the Philippines. It was attended, not only by Filipinos, but people coming from different parts of the globe also went to witness the celebration. The magnificence of the festival made Filipinos, as well as our fellow Asians, refer to it as the “Mother of all Festivals”. From the colorful and well-made costumes of the dancers, to the beautiful dances and to the music brought by the drums, trumpets, and the native gongs, the Sinulog Festival never ceases to amaze its audience.               
            
            For 32 years, the Sinulog Festival is a traditional celebration in Cebu City held every third Sunday of January to honor the Santo Niño (Child Jesus). Basically, the festival is done by a dance ritual, in which it tells the story of the Filipino people’s pagan past and their acceptance of Christianity. The word “Sinulog” means “graceful dance”, wherein it all started in 1980 with a simple dance that represents the “sulog” (or current) of a river in Cebu.

            With the celebration’s evolution, the Sinulog Festival has become a month long tradition in Cebu. The most-awaited feature, nevertheless, is the Sinulog Grand Parade which was held on the 15th day of January. “One Beat, One Dance, One Vision. Cebu – City of Culture” was the theme adopted for the 2012 Sinulog Festival.
                
            As the festival becomes more and more famous each year, tourists would never want to miss the opportunity to watch it and became more and more commercialized. The festival now, not only consists of costumes and dances, but also contests, such as art exhibits, beauty pageants, photo contests, and singing and dancing contests. Participants may also join the festival’s activities, such as concerts, cultural shows, fireworks display, fun runs, and street fairs. For the past 18 years, it has made the Filipinos residing in New Zealand celebrate their own version each year, a proof on how big of an influence the festival is. It has also been recognized as the “City of Culture” by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
                
            The 2012 Sinulog festival embraced the perks of technology, as it was broadcasted live in a major television and, for all the people in the world to see, it was also streamed online.
                
            With the overwhelming amount of people who wish to witness the traditional celebration and the beauty of the culture it depicts, this grand festival remains as Cebu’s proudest attraction, along with the beautiful beaches and historical places.</p>

            <p>Traveling to Cebu, Philippines, is more than just experiencing the sights and sounds. More importantly, it is about witnessing firsthand the culture of the people. And when we talk about culture, transportation is always the most important. After all, how can you enjoy the sights and sounds of Cebu if you do not know how to get around in Cebu?</p>

                <dd>The taxi has been in service of the Cebuanos for centuries, with some of the earliest versions using horse-drawn carriages. If unconventional transportation is a bit too much for you, you can always opt to take the common taxi. Next to the jeepney, the taxicab is the second most popular mode of transportation in Cebu.</dd>
    
                <dt>Jeepney</dt>
                <dd>According to most Cebu travel blogs, the Philippines in general has one of the world’s most unique modes of transportation. This goes way back during the Second World War when the Americans left behind equipment and vehicles after the war. Ingenious as they are, the Filipinos were able to make use of the vehicles that were left behind.</dd>

                <dd>Jeepneys are a welcome sight to most Filipinos. Not only do they provide cheap transportation; they also remind Filipinos of how ingenious they are. Jeepneys are commonly painted in colorful designs that represent different cultures. While some feature Filipino designs, some also bear the influence of other cultures especially when it comes to movies.</dd>
